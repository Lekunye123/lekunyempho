                I’m a passionate 22-year-old woman currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, with an expected graduation date in 2026. My academic journey has been an exciting blend of creativity and technical exploration, and I'm thrilled to continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.

                In mid-2024, I found my true calling in Cybersecurity and have since embarked on an incredible journey. I’m proud to have earned 13 certifications in Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing through Cybrary, solidifying my skills and knowledge in this dynamic area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and discovering new cultures. Whether it's experimenting with new recipes or exploring new destinations, I believe in embracing life’s adventures to the fullest.
