		 <h2>Hello!</h2>
		 <p style= "text-align: left" >

 I’m Mpho Lekunye

I’m a passionate 22-year-old woman currently pursuing <br> my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Limkokwing University <br>of Creative Technology, with an expected graduation date in 2026. My academic <br>journey has been an exciting blend of creativity and technical exploration, and I'm <br> thrilled to continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.<br><br><img src="code.jpg" alt="Image" style="width: 200px; height: auto; vertical-align: center;"></p>
   
<br>
<br>
<p style= "text-align: right">
In mid-2024, I found my true calling in Cybersecurity and have since embarked on <br> an incredible journey. I’m proud to have earned 13 certifications  in Ethical Hacking and <br> Penetration Testing through Cybrary, solidifying my skills and knowledge in this dynamic <br>area. My interest in ethical hacking and security solutions drives me to continually <br> expand my expertise and stay updated on the latest industry trends.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p style= "text-align: left">
When I’m not coding, I love exploring new ideas and challenges. Learning is one <br> of my greatest passions, and I thrive on discovering new concepts, whether through reading,<br> solving problems, or coding.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: right">
Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and discovering new cultures. Whether it's <br> experimenting with new recipes or exploring new destinations, I believe in embracing <br>life’s adventures to the fullest.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Thank you for visiting my site! I hope you find my journey and passions inspiring, and <br>I look forward to connecting with others who share my enthusiasm for technology and <br>personal growth.</p>
